There is an infinite source of material I could write on.

At this point in my life I have experienced much of what life has to offer and by doing so have aquired the ability to have a somewhat sensical opinion on anything I consume. Not only that but I can see the good and bad of both. The ups and downs. I can see the happy in a bad day and the sadness of a passing good one.

In Genesis there exists a garden, and this garden exists within all of us, for we are simply nature expressing itself. Our gardens, filled with pretty clothing and friendly smiles. No garden without its snakes. Accept this. Harness your snakes with articulation, intellect, wisdom and wit to grow yourself above the grass and weeds. Truth is not denying good or bad; it is accepting them harmoneously. You are both God and Satan.

You define What Is so it's up to you if something is good or bad. It is up to you to be affected by events or words. For example, when people call names you can call them out by replying or brush them off and dismiss them. Your choices determine the sacrifice you make.

*"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."* That's Aristotle. People can say just about anything
and you can listen but you don't have to follow their lead or apply
what they say to your life any more than you want to. That's the great thing about this; You can copy what you like from people and disregard what you dislike.

While saying each and every person causes their own contentment and misery would be a great generalization, to the best of my ability I see no reason any person should be held responsible for any other person. If your life is good it is your doing. If your life is bad it is your doing. Of course there
are exceptions however most humans that complain are looking for sympathy, not solutions. 

After all, what you've been looking for your entire life is right in front of you. It's you. You're not lonely, you're always with yourself. You are part of the ever present happening. The living, breathing essence that is our universe. You are the dust and molecules working together meticulously over millions of years coming together to interpret these words. You are made up of so many pieces you couldn't even count them. You're literally all you've ever been waiting for.

One of the reasons we like other people in the first place is because we see ourselves in them. If we talked to ourselves mentally how we do in these relationships mental illness would not be such a rampant issue facing youth and eldery alike. If we were to see ourselves as who we want to be––not characterised by anyone other than ourselves, we would behave very differently.
