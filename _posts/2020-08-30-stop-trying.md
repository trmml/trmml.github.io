A guide to not care so much.

Words fascinated me from a young age. The ability to read is extraordinary however the ability to write is in its own category. One is learning old information while the other is sharing new. While they are two sides of the same coin I valued writing as much if not more than reading until only recently.

The last year has taught me innumerous lessons. Ranging from relationship decisions to career paths to inspirational material there are more stories to share from the last 365 days than any other time period in my lifetime.

Many opportunities have been presented to me this year. However many newly proposed, the majority had existed throughout my entire life and I had been blind to them, roughly speaking. The beginning of 2020 felt like a wake up call in
a way I have difficulty describing. The usher of a new decade brought a wave
of familiar emotions topped with feelings only described accurately through creative writing and expression among those close to me.

One of my biggest goals this year was to do more reading and writing. I have followed through on the former excellentlyâ€“on my way to 50 books this year. My writing however has
dwindled as I find the older I get the larger expectations for quality I place on myself
rather than just releasing what I have to say. This is an expectation
I'm going to overcome with the help of this blog.

The goal of this post is to share some wise words I picked up from a few
books I've been reading which all share a common theme: Stop trying (so hard).

The universe is working against you when you base your worth on extremes. Want to be the richest person in the world? Probably not going to happen. Want to be the next CEO of a multi-billion
dollar company? Possible but very unlikely. These extremes are what limit us on a regular basis when we compare our actions to those of the top 1%. When you realize that you will most likely never land on the moon or have a liquid asset portfolio in the twelve digit range you stop expecting so much of yourself and begin to feel a weight lift off your shoulders.

It's this weight that you can choose to rein in whenever you'd like. The fate of yourself and the world is yours and what you choose to do with that is your decision. Once the weight has been lifted you can assess what you truly want regardless of others' achievements. If you still want to be a billionare then go ahead and do your best working towards that goal. If you want to be a Hollywood star; nobody is stopping you. What is important however is not basing your identity off these goals or accomplishments as you are not comparing yourself to any of the celebrities rather doing it for yourself and yourself only. You are already content 
whether or not these achievements are met or not.

Suffering is the first of the Noble Truths, so to simply not try battling this suffering is a  wise route to ignore it. Another perspective to articulate it with is *choosing your suffering* or rather choose what to try at and what not to try at. Hitherto by trying you have chosen what to put your energy into thus creating goals to conquor this suffering. If you want to withdrawl
these goals entirely you can however when you decide to put your energy into
plans and actions and are met with the inevitable difficulty you won't be so stumped attempting to perfect your work. Instead, you give it your best and call it a day.

Charles Bukowski once said *"What matters most is how well you walk through the fire."* The fire is inevitable; how you take on the fire is what equates to your well-being. By choosing not to try you ascend fiery while refusing to make yourself a victim. By walking through the flames without trying you stand adversely in the face of your problems.
