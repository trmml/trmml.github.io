                <h2>2020-09-02</h2>
                <p>There is an infinite source of material I could write on.</p>
                <p>At this point in my life I have experienced much of what life has to offer and by doing so have aquired the ability to have a somewhat sensical opinion on anything I consume. Not only that but I can see the good and bad of both. The ups and downs. I can see the happy in a bad day and the sadness of a passing good one.</p>
                <p>In Genesis there exists a garden, and this garden exists within all of us, for we are simply nature expressing itself. Our gardens, filled with pretty clothing and friendly smiles. No garden without its snakes. Accept this. Harness your snakes with articulation, intellect, wisdom and wit to grow yourself above the grass and weeds. Truth is not denying good or bad; it is accepting them harmoneously. You are both God and Satan.</p>
                <p>You define What Is so it's up to you if something is good or bad. It is up to you to be affected by events or words. For example, when people call names you can call them out by replying or brush them off and dismiss them. Your choices determine the sacrifice you make.</p>
                <p>
                    <i>"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."</i> That's Aristotle. People can say just about anything
                        and you can listen but you don't have to follow their lead or apply
                        what they say to your life any more than you want to. That's the great thing about this; You can copy what you like from people and disregard what you dislike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While saying each and every person causes their own contentment and misery would be a great generalization, to the best of my ability I see no reason any person should be held responsible for any other person. If your life is good it is your doing. If your life is bad it is your doing. Of course there
                    are exceptions however most humans that complain are looking for sympathy, not solutions. 
                    After all, what you've been looking for your entire life is right in front of you. It's you. You're not lonely, you're always with yourself. You are part of the ever present happening. The living, breathing essence that is our universe. You are the dust and molecules working together meticulously over millions of years coming together to interpret these words. You are made up of so many pieces you couldn't even count them. You're literally all you've ever been waiting for.
                </p>

                    One of the reasons we like other people in the first place is because we see ourselves in them. If we talked to ourselves mentally how we do in these relationships mental illness would not be such a rampant issue facing youth and eldery alike. If we were to see ourselves as who we want to be‚Äì‚Äìnot characterised by anyone other than ourselves, we would behave very differently.

                <h2>2020-08-30</h2>
                <p>A guide to not care so much.</p>
                <p>Words fascinated me from a young age. The ability to read is extraordinary. The ability to write is in its own category. One is learning old information while the other is sharing new. While they are two sides of the same coin I valued writing more than reading until only recently.
                <p>The last year has taught me innumerous lessons. Ranging from relationship decisions to career paths to inspirational material there are more stories to share from the last 365 days than any other time period in my lifetime.</p>
                <p>
                    Many opportunities have been presented to me this year. However many newly proposed, the majority had existed throughout my entire life and I had been blind to them, roughly speaking. The beginning of 2020 felt like a wake up call in
                    a way I have difficulty describing. The usher of a new decade brought a wave
                    of familiar emotions topped with feelings only described accurately through creative writing and expression among those close to me.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    One of my biggest goals this year was to do more reading and writing. I have followed through on the former excellently‚Äìon my way to 50 books this year. My writing however has
                    dwindled as I find the older I get the larger expectations for quality I place on myself
                    rather than just releasing what I have to say. This is an expectation
                    I'm going to overcome with the help of this blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this post is to share some wise words I picked up from a few
                    books I've been reading which all share a common theme: Stop trying (so hard).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The universe is working against you when you base your worth on extremes. Want to be the richest person in the world? Probably not going to happen. Want to be the next CEO of a multi-billion
                    dollar company? Possible but very unlikely. These extremes are what limit us on a regular basis when we compare our actions to those of the top 1%. When you realize that you will most likely never land on the moon or have a liquid asset portfolio in the twelve digit range you stop expecting so much of yourself and begin to feel a weight lift off your shoulders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's this weight that you can choose to rein in whenever you'd like. The fate of yourself and the world is yours and what you choose to do with that is your decision. Once the weight has been lifted you can assess what you truly want regardless of others' achievements. If you still want to be a billionare then go ahead and do your best working towards that goal. If you want to be a Hollywood star; nobody is stopping you. What is important however is not basing your identity off these goals or accomplishments as you are not comparing yourself to any of the celebrities rather doing it for yourself and yourself only. You are already content 
                    whether or not these achievements are met or not.

                    Suffering is the first of the Noble Truths, so to simply not try battling this suffering is a  wise route to ignore it. Another perspective to articulate it with is <i>choosing your suffering</i> or rather choose what to try at and what not to try at. Hitherto by trying you have chosen what to put your energy into thus creating goals to conquor this suffering. If you want to withdrawl
                    these goals entirely you can however when you decide to put your energy into
                    plans and actions and are met with the inevitable difficulty you won't be so stumped attempting to perfect your work. Instead, you give it your best and call it a day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charles Bukowski once said <i>"What matters most is how well you walk through the fire."</i> The fire is inevitable; how you take on the fire is what equates to your well-being. By choosing not to try you ascend fiery while refusing to make yourself a victim. By walking through the flames without trying you stand adversely in the face of your problems.
